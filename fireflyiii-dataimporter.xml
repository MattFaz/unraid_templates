    <Overview>Firefly III" is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you
        keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. The data
        importer is built to help you import transactions into Firefly III. It is separated from
        Firefly III for security and maintenance reasons.
        The data importer can import CSV files you've downloaded from your bank, or it can use
        Nordigen and SaltEdge to connect to over 6000 banks worldwide. These services are free for
        Firefly III users, but require registration. Keep in mind these services have their own
        privacy and data usage policies.
        You can run the data importer once, for a bulk import. You can also run it regularly to keep
        up with new transactions.</Overview>
